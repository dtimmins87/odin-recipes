<img src="../images/salad.jpg">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I was trying to come up with a flavorful salad that did not need dressing.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups lettuce leaves, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup grape tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>Â½ cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place asparagus in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over asparagus and season with garlic powder; toss well. Transfer asparagus to a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until asparagus are tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place lettuce in the same bowl used for asparagus; top with tomatoes, feta cheese, and asparagus.</li>
    </ol>
